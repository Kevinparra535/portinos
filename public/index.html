			1 Max Turbo Frequency refers to the maximum single-core processor
			frequency that can be achieved with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology.
			<br />
			2 Altering clock frequency or voltage may damage or reduce the useful
			life of the processor and other system components, and may reduce system
			stability and performance. Product warranties may not apply if the
			processor is operated beyond its specifications. Check with the
			manufacturers of system and components for additional details.
			<br />
			<br />
			375% Latency reduction: Is based on Intel simulation data (79%) of
			802.11ax with and without O FDMA using 9 clients. Average latency
			without OFDM is 36ms, with OFDMA average latency is reduced to 7.6ms.
			Latency improvement requires that the 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) router and all
			clients support OFDMA.
			<br />
			4 Nearly 3X Faster: 802.11ax 2x2 160 MHz enables 2402 Mbps maximum
			theoretical data rates, ~3X (2.8X) faster than standard 802.11ac 2x2 80
			MHz (867 Mbps) as documented in IEEE 802.11 wireless standard
			specifications, and require the use of similarly configured 802.11ax
			wireless network routers.
